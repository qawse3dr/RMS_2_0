FEATURES
  - execute script on computer
    - have a folder which holds all the script names (set in cfg)
    - send the script data over thrift then saved in a tmp dir on the target which get's deleted
      after running (maybe make deleting an option)
  
  - send info to Database
    - network
    - network usage
  - Create optional callback server for faster updates.
    - Create its own thrift tcp socket the server can send requests to for example to request
      sys-info, or to create a virtual remote shell like client.
  - Create Logger or a one maybe as a separate project so i can reuse it for other cpp projects  
  - get usb devices
    maybe use e-bpf to detect new devices so I know when to add
  - get bluetooth devices
  - get running processes (don't save anywhere)
    - pid
    - usage
    - name
  - get running services
  - installed pkg's
  - more sys info

    - ram speeds
    - bios version (If I can get this)
  
BUGS
  - if the server dies the client will endlessly try to reconnect (expected)
    but ctrl + C doesn't work (not expected)


REFACTOR
  - Have a pool of consumers that get jobs given to it
    having a thread per consumer could be wasting performance so a queue job might
    be useful to decrease thread count without losing performance.

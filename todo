BUGS

REFACTOR
  - Have a pool of consumers that get jobs given to it
    having a thread per consumer could be wasting performance so a queue job might
    be useful to decrease thread count without losing performance.
  - Change programs to use pthread_sigmask()
  - The server and reporter code should really be gutted and fixed up
  - There is not really flow or to how the code is written. There should be a
    singleton class that controls everything, so from main a single function
    can be called to start. this will also make it easier to hold shared data
    such as the computers on the server (Done for server)

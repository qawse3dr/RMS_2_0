BUGS
  - Ticks for data are saving negative numbers... (might have to do how it is saved to db or sent over thrift)

REFACTOR
  - Have a pool of consumers that get jobs given to it
    having a thread per consumer could be wasting performance so a queue job might
    be useful to decrease thread count without losing performance.
  - figure a better way to sleep besides sleep (maybe sleep for timeout but in 1 second intervals)
